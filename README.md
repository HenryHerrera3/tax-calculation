The Tax Calculation Challenge
=============================

This is a solution for the Tax Calculation Challenge presented by [Ayende](http://ayende.com/blog/108545/the-tax-calculation-challenge).

It took some 50 mins in total (the 30mins from initial commit to second commit was an attempt to get node and npm up and running).

I attacked the problem with BDD in mind, and the progress can be easily followed in the commit-log.
